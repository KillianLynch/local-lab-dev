## About Oracle Database 23c

Oracle Database 23c builds on the strengths of its predecessor, 19c, offering a converged database that excels in managing various data types, including relational, JSON, XML, spatial, graph, and more. With a focus on high performance, availability, security, and scalability, Oracle Database 23c provides a robust data management platform suitable for both cloud and on-premises environments.

In addition to its unparalleled support for diverse workloads, Oracle Database 23c boasts the world's most advanced SQL engine. It ensures fully consistent data with ACID transaction guarantees, adheres to the latest ISO SQL standard, and remains an open and comprehensive database solution.

The converged database approach empowers users with flexibility, allowing multiple instances of the database to be configured according to specific data models and workload types. This approach eliminates the need to grapple with different single-purpose database architectures, diverse tooling, security models, patching schedules, upgrade paths, and integration challenges. Just like a versatile Swiss army knife, Oracle Database 23c lets you tailor the core engine to your specific use case, whether it's document storage, relational databases, spatial data, graph databases, and more.

For microservices architectures, Oracle Database supports independent development and deployment of application modules through containerized data stores in the form of pluggable databases within the container database. This multitenant container architecture in the data tier provides consolidation, isolation, and agility, aligning with containerization in the app tier. 

Oracle Database 23c represents the latest long-term release, offering cutting-edge technologies to users. If you are currently using Oracle Database 19c or 21c, you can directly upgrade to Oracle Database 23c.
