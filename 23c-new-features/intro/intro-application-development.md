# Introduction

Welcome to the Application Development focus area of the workshop! This section is dedicated to hands-on labs that highlight the latest enhancements and features in Oracle Database 23c for application development. While this is not an exhaustive list of new features, we've chosen to spotlight six particularly exciting ones: JSON Duality Views, Property Graphs, SQL Domains, Annotations, JavaScript Stored Procedures, and JSON Schema. Through these labs, you'll gain practical experience with these features and understand how they can enhance your development projects.

## About Oracle Database 23c

Building on the strengths of its predecessor, Oracle Database 23c represents the latest long-term release, delivering cutting-edge technologies to users. Just like Oracle Database 19c, version 23c provides best-in-class support for all data types, including relational, JSON, XML, spatial, graph, and OLAP, coupled with industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, and security for various workloads.

Users of Oracle Database 19c and 21c can directly upgrade to Oracle Database 23c.

## About the Application Development New Features Section

This section empowers you to explore and experiment with some of the new Application Development features in Oracle Database 23c.

* **Application Development Features:**
    - **JSON Duality Views** - In Oracle Database 23c the JSON Duality views allow you to access data stored in the Oracle database as if it were either JSON documents or standard relational tables. This means that applications can access (create, query, modify) the same data as a set of JSON documents or as a set of related tables and columns, and both approaches can be employed at the same time.
    - **Oracle Property Graphs** - The Oracle Database has had a graph server and client for some time. However, in Oracle Database 23c, support for graphs has been built directly into the database. Additionally, new in 23c is the ability to build graph applications, manipulate, and query those graphs using SQL/PGQ, the preferred ANSI SQL standard for building graph applications..
    - **SQL Domains** - Oracle Database 23c introduces SQL domain, a dictionary object that belongs to a schema and encapsulates a set of optional properties and constraints for common values, such as credit card numbers or email addresses.
    - **Annotations** - Annotations enable you to store and retrieve metadata about database objects. They are free-form text fields applications can use to customize business logic or user interfaces. Annotations are name-value pairs or simply a name.
    - **JavaScript Stored Procedures** - This feature let you use JavaScript functions anywhere PL/SQL functions are called.
    - **JSON Schema** - With Oracle Database 23c, Oracle Database now supports JSON Schema to validate structure and values of JSON data. The SQL operator IS JSON was enhanced to accept a JSON Schema, and various PL/SQL functions were added to validate JSON and to describe database objects such as tables, views, and types as JSON Schema documents.
