# Working with JSON and the Duality Views

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to work with JSON documents in the Oracle 23c database. We'll show you how to populate the tables and subsequent duality views, as well as filter, replace, fetch, update, and delete JSON documents by predicates. Finally, we'll let you test out non-updateable fields.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes
